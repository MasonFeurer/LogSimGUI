## LogSimGUI
Was originally a typo, but is now the name of a Logic Gate simulator. This app is coded in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with the [EGUI framework](https://crates.io/crates/eframe).

## Running
For MacOS, there are built binaries in `/releases`.

To build and run from source:
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/MasonFeurer/LogSimGUI.git"
cd LogSimGUI
cargo run
```
Note: as of now, LogSimGUI is only tested on MacOS, so it may not work well if you build it on some other machine.
