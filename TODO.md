- Add clock device
- Add bus device
- Allow for links to be created with anchor points (maybe without changing save format of Scene?)
- Make a tutorial
- BEFORE NEXT RELEASE: Add code for loading the old presets and updating them to the new data layout
- BUG: The debug window will show up even if IMADEV isn't pressed in order, or if you press random keys in between
